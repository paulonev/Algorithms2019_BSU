Hello!
This readme was written with one matter, because I wanted to say
that I'm really very excited about implementing and learning different algorithms although it's expected to be a long and difficult journey!

TO-DO for summer 2020:
1) implement *HashTables* storage possibilities using Java or C#
2) find bugs in finite automata for substring search algorithm in project *TuringMachine*
3) write some multithreading algorithms for example for *Genetic Algorithms*

Have a nice day, YOU!
